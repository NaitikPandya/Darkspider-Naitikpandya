				<h1>Air Pollution</h1>
				<div class="po-info text">
					<article>Air pollution is a mixture of solid particles and gases in the air. Car emissions, 		chemicals 	from factories, dust, pollen and mold spores may be suspended as particles. 		Ozone, a gas, is a 			major part of air pollution in cities. When ozone forms air 		pollution, it's also called smog.
						<br>
						<br>
						Some air pollutants are poisonous. Inhaling them can increase the chance you'll have health problems. People with heart or lung disease, older adults and children are at greater risk from air pollution. Air pollution isn't just outside - the air inside buildings can also be polluted and affect your health.
						<br>
						<br>
						Most air pollution comes from energy use and production,” says John Walke, director of the Clean Air Project, part of the Climate and Clean Air program at NRDC. “Burning fossil fuels releases gases and chemicals into the air.” And in an especially destructive feedback loop, air pollution not only contributes to climate change but is also exacerbated by it.
						<br>
						<br>
						 “Air pollution in the form of carbon dioxide and methane raises the earth’s temperature,” Walke says. “Another type of air pollution is then worsened by that increased heat: Smog forms when the weather is warmer and there’s more ultraviolet radiation.” Climate change also increases the production of allergenic air pollutants including mold (thanks to damp conditions caused by extreme weather and increased flooding) and pollen (due to a longer pollen season and more pollen production).

				<h1>Water Pollution</h1>
				<div class="po-info text">
					<article>This widespread problem of water pollution is jeopardizing our health. Unsafe water kills more people each year than war and all other forms of violence combined. Meanwhile, our drinkable water sources are finite: Less than 1 percent of the earth’s freshwater is actually accessible to us. Without action, the challenges will only increase by 2050, when global demand for freshwater is expected to be one-third greater than it is now.
						<br>
						<br>
						Sip a glass of cool, clear water as you read this, and you may think water pollution is a problem . . . somewhere else. But while most Americans have access to safe drinking water, potentially harmful contaminants—from arsenic to copper to lead—have been found in the tap water of every single state in the nation.
						<br>
						<br>
						Still, we’re not hopeless against the threat to clean water. To better understand the problem and what we can do about it, here’s an overview of what water pollution is, what causes it, and how we can protect ourselves.
						<br>
						<br>
						 Water is uniquely vulnerable to pollution. Known as a “universal solvent,” water is able to dissolve more substances than any other liquid on earth. It’s the reason we have Kool-Aid and brilliant blue waterfalls. It’s also why water is so easily polluted. Toxic substances from farms, towns, and factories readily dissolve into and mix with it, causing water pollution.

				<h1>Land Pollution</h1>
				<div class="po-info text">
					<article>Land Pollution refers to the deterioration of the earth’s land surfaces. Furthermore, it occurs mainly due to the indirect and direct effects of human activities. Similarly, when we misuse the land resources, land pollution happens.
						<br>
						<br>
						There are various causes which contribute to this pollution. The various substances that spill on the land cause land pollution. Similarly, these substances have different sources of origin.
						<br>
						<br>
						As we know that forests and grassland bind the soil. We must practice reforestation to protect the land from pollution. It will further prevent floods and soil erosion. Moreover, it will make the land more fertile and enhance biodiversity.
						<br>
						<br>
						 We must recycle waste material to stop it from polluting the land. We must properly dispose of organic and inorganic waste separately. It will help in lessening the burden of landfills. Moreover, it will save more natural resources.
